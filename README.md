# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
I recently completed an HR Analytics Dashboard project using Power BI.The project aimed to provide a comprehensive view of key HR metrics to support data-driven decision-making.
Here are the key performance indicators (KPIs) and charts featured in the dashboard:

#Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

1.Count of Employees: Displays the total number of employees in the organization.

2.Total Number of Attrition Employees: Indicates the total count of employees who have left the organization.

3.Attrition Rate: Measures the percentage of employees leaving the company over a specific period.

4.Average Salary: Shows the average salary of employees across the organization.

5.Average Years of Service: Indicates the average tenure of employees.

6.Attrition by Gender: Analyzes the attrition rate by gender.

7.Average Age of Employees: Displays the average age of employees.

#Charts and Visualizations:

Attrition Analysis:

1.Donut Chart: Visualizes attrition by education level, providing insights into which educational backgrounds have higher turnover rates.

2.Stacked Column Chart: Illustrates attrition by age group, helping to identify which age groups are most prone to leaving the organization.

3.Stacked Bar Chart: Represents attrition by salary and job role, allowing for analysis of how compensation and job roles affect employee retention.

4.Area Chart: Tracks the number of years employees stay with the company, showing trends in tenure over time.

#Dashboard Insights:

1.Data-Driven Decisions: The dashboard enables HR professionals to make informed decisions based on real-time data.

2.Trend Analysis: By visualizing historical data, the dashboard helps in identifying patterns and forecasting future HR needs.

3.Diversity Insights: Analysis of attrition by gender and education helps understand diversity and inclusion challenges.

4.Compensation Analysis: Visualization of average salary and its impact on attrition rates informs compensation strategies.

5.Employee Engagement: Tracking tenure and average age alongside attrition provides insights into employee engagement and satisfaction.
